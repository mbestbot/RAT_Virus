To run:

To get the server.exe, you need to install PyInstaller and run:

pyinstaller server.py
This will generate everything and allow you to run the script.cmd.

If you just want to test on a local machine and do not need to generate the .exe, you can simply run on one terminal:

python3 server.py
And on another terminal:

python3 client.py
